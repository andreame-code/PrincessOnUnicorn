# Manual Testing Scenarios

## Level 1: Enchanted Forest
1. Open the game with `?level=1` in the URL.
2. Confirm tree obstacles appear at varying intervals.

## Level 2: Knight's Gauntlet
1. Open the game with `?level=2`.
2. Observe the knight boss on the right edge and walls thrown toward the player.
3. Activate the shield (space bar or click) before a wall arrives and ensure the wall is destroyed and a coin appears.
4. Let the shield expire and miss a wall to confirm the game ends.

## Level 3: Unicornolandia

2. Verify small cactus obstacles spawn according to the level layout.
